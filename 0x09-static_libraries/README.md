Static libraries

A library is a file containing several object files, that can be used as a single entity in a linking phase of a program.

Unix systems (as well as most other modern systems) allow us to create and use two kinds of libraries - static libraries and shared (or dynamic) libraries.

Static libraries are just collections of object files that are linked into the program during the linking phase of compilation, and are not relevant during runtime.

Shared libraries (also called dynamic libraries) are linked into the program in two stages. First, during compile time, the linker verifies that all the symbols (again, functions, variables and the like) required by the program, are either linked into the program, or in one of its shared libraries. However, the object files from the dynamic library are not inserted into the executable file. Instead, when the program is started, a program in the system (called a dynamic loader) checks out which shared libraries were linked with the program, loads them to memory, and attaches them to the copy of the program in memory.

Tasks

0. Create the static library libmy.a
1. Create a script called create_static_lib.sh that creates a static library called liball.a from all the .c files that are in the current directory.
